// Property tests of the write builders of src/shared/game/guildTables.ts (addItems, takeOffItem, restoreItem, addCreature, setCreatureRemoved,
// renameCreature, moveCreature, resetCreature, addZone, editZone, setZoneInPhase, resetZone), from the spec (PR-texts/Design-loot-tables-phases.md,
// "Edits in the editor"). A write is applied to a list of documents the way the audited helper does (support/tableWrites.ts), the lists are merged again
// at the same phase and the intended effect is checked, together with what must stay as it was: the lists of earlier phases, the other creatures and
// zones, the documents of other phases. Every document a write leaves behind is checked against the shape rules of the spec. Single operations on
// random states, then sequences of 2 to 6 operations across phases N and N+1. Deterministic: seeded, and Math.random is replaced while a builder
// that uses it runs. To prove the tests can fail, point GUILD_TABLES_MODULE at a changed copy of the module.
